## Introduction
Credit card fraud is one of the most prevalent financial crimes today. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is a critical challenge. 
This project leverages machine learning techniques to identify patterns that indicate fraudulent behavior.

The project includes the implementation of three popular machine learning models:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
Each model is trained and evaluated on the same dataset to compare their performance in fraud detection.
## Technologies Used
* Python: The programming language used for the project.
* Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning models.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: For numerical computations.
* Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Jupyter Notebooks : For exploratory data analysis and model testing

Modeling Techniques
1. Logistic Regression
A linear model for binary classification, used here to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
2. Decision Tree
A tree-like structure that splits the data into subsets based on feature values, used to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
3. Random Forest
An ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees and merges them to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
Each model is evaluated using the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results
The performance of each model is evaluated on the test set and compared. The models' results are presented in the form of:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
These metrics help evaluate the effectiveness of the models in identifying fraudulent transactions.
